Ecosystem modeling approaches are valuable tools to uncover potential mechanisms behind the ecosystem changes. Here, we developed ‘OSMOSE-YS’, an individual-based multi-species OSMOSE model that includes important commercial pelagic and demersal fish and invertebrates in the Yellow Sea. Simulations were carried out under three fishing scenarios to investigate how different levels of fishing pressure may have impacted the Yellow Sea ecosystem. Results indicate that the biomass of demersal fish continued to decline during 1970–2014, while the biomass of pelagic fish and invertebrates fluctuated periodically. Long-term fishing pressure has led to the reduction of total biomass, body sizes, and longevity of the modelled species. Under low-fishing condition, the ecosystem biomass is restored and the proportion of elder and larger individuals increases. On the contrary, high-fishing condition further decreases the proportion of high-trophic-level species. OSMOSE-YS serves as a baseline model to investigate ecosystem responses to different fishing strategies, in support of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the Yellow Sea.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Exploring fishing impacts on the structure and functioning of the Yellow Sea ecosystem using an individual-based modeling approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Runlong Sun","Peng Sun","Caihong Fu","Guankui Liu","Zhenlin Liang","Yunne-Jai Shin","Nicolas Barrier","Mikko Heino"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Fishing patterns in some developing countries (e.g. China, the largest producer of seafood) closely resemble BH, where catches have been highly diversified by unselective gears due to market demand for almost all species. In this study, we employed an OSMOSE ecosystem model developed for the Yellow Sea in China to investigate the potential occurrences and advantages of BH in this region with highly exploited multispecies fisheries. Simulations were carried out under four types of fishing scenarios, where various levels of fishing mortality rates for all species or specific functional groups were implemented. Results indicated that the occurrences of BH depended on fishing pressure and targeted functional groups, and that size-level BH was significantly correlated with biomass and yield for most species. In particular, varying fishing pressure for certain functional groups resulted in BH, which produced a high yield for specific species and ensured their biomass sustainability. We concluded that the benefits of BH could be potentially achieved by adjusting fishing pressure for certain functional groups based on the existing fishing pattern in over-exploited ecosystems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Exploring balanced harvest as a potential strategy for highly exploited multispecies fisheries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siqing Xu","Peng Sun","Chi Zhang","Jianchao Li","Xiaoyu Xi","Shuyang Ma","Wenchao Zhang","Yongjun Tian"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Such phenotypic changes include smaller in size and earlier age-at-maturation, strongly suggesting that fishing could induce rapid changes in the life-history traits of fish. However, whether extensive fishing will lead to genetic changes in fish, how they occur, and whether they are reversible still requires further research. In this study, we analyzed biological traits of marine medaka (*Oryzias melastigma*) subjected to 50% experimental harvest for 4 consecutive generations. This study adopted a factorial design with three size-selective harvesting strategies (large-, small-, and random-size selection) on groups either before or after maturation. We compared the growth, maturation, and early life stages of marine medaka for different harvesting strategies. The results showed that the mean lengths and mean weights in large-harvested populations significantly declined after 4 generations, whereas small-harvested populations did the opposite. Furthermore, selective harvesting of large individuals also led to earlier maturation, declining fecundity, declining hatching rate and increasing larval mortality. Importantly, compared to harvesting before maturation, harvesting after maturation could mitigate the effects of harvest on biological traits. This study provided experimental evidence for the impact of selective harvest on phenotypic evolution and contributed to the theoretical basis for sustainability in fisheries and fishery management.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Size-selective harvesting alters biological traits of marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuo Cheng","Peng Sun","Liu Yang","Qi Chen","Zhengtong Shi","Runlong Sun"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To explore its current biological characters, we analyzed age, growth and maturation of largehead hairtail in the East China Sea by analyzing the otolith microstructure and gonads. The results showed that largehead hairtail is mainly composed of 1 year and 2 years old individuals. The estimated von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) showed significant differences between sexes, and asymptotic pre-anal length of male is longer than that of female. Two spawning seasons were observed in spring and autumn by monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI). Compared to historic survey data, the average pre-anal length at age decreased and size-at-maturation became smaller in the East China Sea.

Stow net is the main fishing gear to capture commercially important fish species small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China. Long-term stow net selective harvest affects both the biological characters and economic benefits of small yellow croaker. Therefore, an appropriate harvest scenario that can achieve the high economic benefits and the sustainable use of resource needs to be explored. In this study, we develop a bio-economic model for small yellow croaker and focus on different harvest scenarios for obtaining maximum economic benefit and sustainable utilization of resource. Our results indicate that the increase in mesh size has positive effects on the protection of small yellow croaker population, and optimal harvest scenario achieves the short- or long-term economic benefits to different stakeholders. Fishing with small mesh size gets high economic value in short-term, while fishing with large mesh size achieves better economic value and effectively protect small yellow croaker resource under long-term fishing pressure. This study provides evidence to balance the long-term economic benefits and sustainable utilization of fishery resource, and it also offers a basis for the scientific formulation of fishery policy.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Effects of Selective Harvest on Exploited Population and Economic Benefits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Sun","Yangke Shang","Runlong Sun","Yongjun Tian","Mikko Heino"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This species has been yielding high fisheries production despite experiencing continuously high fishing pressure and the conversion from gillnet to trawl harvesting. Meanwhile, changes in life-history traits have been observed, including earlier maturation and smaller size at age. Here, we build an individual-based eco-genetic model parameterized for Japanese Spanish mackerel to investigate the population’s response to different fishing scenarios (fishing by trawl or by gillnet). The model allows evolution of life-history processes including maturation, reproduction and growth. It also incorporates environmental variability, phenotypic plasticity, and density-dependent feedbacks. Our results show that different gear types can result in different responses of life-history traits and altered population dynamics. The population harvested by gillnet shows weaker response to fishing than that by trawl. When fishing ceases, gillnet-harvested population can recover to the pre-harvest level more easily than that harvested by trawl. The different responses of population growth rate and evolution to different fishing gears demonstrated in this study shed light on the sustainable management and utilization of Japanese Spanish mackerel in the over-exploited China Seas.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Effects of Selective Harvest on Japanese Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius) Phenotypic Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
